        <h2>What is tilapia?</h2>
        <p>Tilapia is a freshwater white fish with a pleasantly flaky texture and mild flavor. It's one of the most popular types of fish in the United States because it's inexpensive, easy to find, and easy to prepare.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 tilapia fillets, 4 ounce each</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice, or to taste, optional</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley, or to taste, optional</li>
            <li>Â½ teaspoon chopped fresh thyme, or to taste, optional</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Rinse tilapia fillets in cold water and pat dry with paper towels. Season both sides of each fillet with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Place flour in a shallow dish. Gently press each fillet into the flour to coat and shake off any excess.</li>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook tilapia fillets in the hot oil, in batches if necessary, until fish flakes easily with a fork, about 4 minutes per side.</li>
            <li>Brush melted butter onto the tilapia fillets in the last minute before removing from the skillet.</li>
            <li>Drizzle fillets with lemon juice and garnish with parsley and thyme.</li>
        </ol>
